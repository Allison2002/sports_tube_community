            <p>
              Baseball is a game steeped in history, tradition, and fierce
              competition. Among the most captivating aspects of the sport are
              the rivalries that ignite passions and create unforgettable
              moments. From iconic matchups to legendary players, these
              rivalries have shaped the game and drawn fans together. In this
              article, we will examine some of baseball's greatest rivalries,
              exploring their histories, key games, and the players who defined
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Yankees vs. Red Sox</strong><br>
              Arguably the most famous rivalry in sports, the New York Yankees
              and Boston Red Sox have been battling it out since the early 20th
              century. The rivalry intensified after the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth
              to the Yankees in 1919, a decision that led to an 86-year
              championship drought for Boston, famously referred to as the
              "Curse of the Bambino."

                  curse with a World Series victory.
